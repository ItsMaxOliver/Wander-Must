# Create React Express App

## About This Boilerplate

This setup allows for a Node/Express/React app which can be easily deployed to Heroku.

The front-end React app will auto-reload as it's updated via webpack dev server, and the backend Express app will auto-reload independently with nodemon.

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
yarn install
``

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
yarn start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Application

Planning a trip requires more research than most users have the time or energy to carry out. We add a personal touch to packing, creating a shared space for like-minded travelers to compare notes, relive vacations, and give others ideas on where to go and what to bring.


## Motivation

World travelers generally spend several hours scouring the internet for information on what they should or shouldn't take on a trip to a particular part of the world. Information can be difficult to sift through, and the information that is available lacks consistency, context, and any sort of personal experience to lend it credence. Wander-Must serves as a user-friendly exploration of other users' personal experiences, organized in a way that makes planning for trips painless and fun. Each trip contains user details and personalization that contextualize these experiences, leading to a more accurate understanding of what to pack for a specific trip.


## Design Process

Wander-Must is designed as both a desktop and mobile social network, but any future development will focus on the mobile experience and standalone apps, as we believe that users will use the service primarily from their phones.

The color scheme and design were chosen to impart a modern, feminine aesthetic, as we have identified women as the primary demographic for our application. The site has a clean, straightforward look designed to make the user experience as painless as possible, providing a number of customizable options that never overwhelm the user.
